Here is my take on falafel wrap. Its different from the traditional one but equally healthy and delicious. My version involves a salad prepared from baked veggies and quick and easy to make dressing.

# Gotta love your Veggies !

* The very first step is to take all the veggies you love and roughly chop it. I took the following veggies,
* 1/2 Beetroot
* 1/2 Broccoli
* 1/2 Zucchini
* 1/2 Onion
* 1/2 Tomato
* 1/2 Carrot
* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper
* 1/2 Green Bell Pepper
* 4 Cloves of Garlic and split into halves

* Spread all the veggies and garlic halves on a baking tray and drizzle Olive Oil on it.
* Season it with Black Pepper, Salt and Mix Herbs as per taste.

* Bake it an oven at 375 degrees F for 15 - 20 mins and if required broil it for last 5 mins.
* After 15 - 20 mins, take out the baking tray from oven and let it cool.

# Supercharge the Veggies !

* Lets prepare dressing to mix it with our Veggies.
* Take a salad bowl and add the following,
* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
* 1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper
* 1 Tsp Mixed Herbs
* 1 Tsp Dried Parsley
* Salt to taste
* Optional Red Chili flakes as per Spice Level

* Chop the baked garlic into small pieces and add it to the dressing.
* Add one stalk of finely chopped Green/Spring Onion to the dressing.
* Mix it with light hand and let it rest for 5-10 mins, so that taste of all the spices/herbs and garlic gets infused into the olive oil.

* Add roughly chopped 10-15 leaves of Baby Spinach and Arugula and add it to the dressing.
* Also add 1/2 chopped Cucumber and 1/2 chopped Avocado and mix it into dressing along with all of our baked Veggies.
* Finally, let's add some crumbled Goat or Feta Cheese. I used [Goat Cheese with Garlic and Herbs](https://shop.sprouts.com/product/9891/crooked-creek-garlic-herb-goat-cheese).
* Mix everything with light hand.

# This is where the Magic Happens !

- Get some Pita Pockets and warm it up little bit. I used [Tofuayan Pita Pockets](https://shop.sprouts.com/product/57483/toufayan-original-sandwich-smart-pockets) and warmed up 4 Pockets in microwave for 12 seconds.
- We obviously need Falafel. I got [Hannah Organic Falafel Veggie Pattie](https://hannahfoods.net/falafel) from Costco and warmed up 4 of them in microwave for 2 mins.
- Spread [Red Pepper Hummus](https://shop.sprouts.com/product/57896/market-corner-organic-roasted-red-pepper-hummus) on one side within the Pita Pocket and [Tzatziki](https://shop.sprouts.com/product/28249/sprouts-tzatziki-sauce) on other side.
- Layer the Salad and Falafel (I prefer crumbled) into the pita pocket.

- Top it off with some [Cilantro Dressing](https://shop.sprouts.com/product/53523/primal-kitchen-cilantro-lime-avocado-oil-dressing) and optionally add some Shredded Cheese of your choice.


# Wala ! Falafel Pita Wrap is ready.
* Savor it with more Tzatziki sauce or Sriracha (any hot) sauce.
